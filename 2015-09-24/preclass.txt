0.  How much time did you spend on this pre-class exercise, and when?

1.  What are one or two points that you found least clear in the
    9/24 slide decks (including the narration)?

    on page 20 of OpenMP:
    what are essential and accidental complexity?

    on page 8 of HW concerns:
    why some are false sharing?

2.  The omp_mc.c file in the demo subdirectory runs a Monte Carlo
    simulation to estimate the expected value of a uniform random
    variable.  The "-p" option sets the number of processors used,
    while "-b" sets the number of trials between synchronizations.

    a) Write a model for the run time for this simulation code in
       terms of the number of trials (N), number of processors (p),
       time per trial (t_trial), and time to update the global
       counters in the critical section (t_update).

       computation = N * t_trial / p 
       synchronization = N * t_update / b
       run time = computation + synchronization = N * t_trial / p + N * t_update / b

    b) Run the code with a few different parameter values in order
       to estimate N, t_trial, and t_update for this code on
       a totient compute node.

       --- Run input parameters:
       rtol:      1.000000e-04
       maxtrials: 10000000
       nbatch:    1000
       0.499968 (9.12018e-05) from 10024000 trials
       24 threads (OpenMP): 2.857304e-02 s
       --- Run input parameters:
       rtol:      1.000000e-04
       maxtrials: 10000000
       nbatch:    2000
       0.499949 (9.10922e-05) from 10048000 trials
       24 threads (OpenMP): 5.704117e-02 s

       N = 10000000
       p = 24
       b = 1000 or 2000

    c) Based on your model, suggest a strategy for choosing the batch
       size.  How might you generalize this strategy to automatically
       choose batch sizes for different types of computational
       experiments?

3.  The "OpenMP pitfalls" paper describes some common pitfalls (both
    performance and correctness) in OpenMP codes.  Go through the
    checklist in the paper for omp_mc.c.  What performance mistakes
    are there in the demonstration implementation?
