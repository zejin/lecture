## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?
  Time to start the process = S
  Time to compute row counts = M * t_count
  Time for the instructor to gather counts = N * t_gather  
  Time for instructor to do the arithmetic = N * t_arith
    
  where M = number of students in one row
        N = number of rows
        t_count = time to count one student
        t_gather = time to gather a count
        t_arith = time to do an addition

  Then X = S + M * t_count + N * t_gather + N * t_arith

2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?
  Total number of students = M * N
  Total time to count all students = M * N * t_count

  Then Y = M * N * t_count

3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

  X < Y
  if and only if
  S + M * t_count + N * t_gather + N * t_arith < M * N * t_count
